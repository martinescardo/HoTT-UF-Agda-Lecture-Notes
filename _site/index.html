<p><strong>Abstract.</strong> We introduce <a href="http://www.math.ias.edu/Voevodsky/">Voevodsky</a>’s <a href="http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/2018-55-04/S0273-0979-2018-01616-9/">univalent foundations</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath/blob/master/README.md">univalent mathematics</a>, and explain how to develop them with the
computer system <a href="https://wiki.portal.chalmers.se/agda/pmwiki.php">Agda</a>, which based on <a href="https://github.com/michaelt/martin-lof">Martin-Löf type theory</a>.</p>

<p>Agda allows us to write mathematical definitions, constructions,
theorems and proofs, for example in number theory, analysis, group
theory, topology, category theory or programming language theory, checking
them for logical and mathematical correctness.</p>

<p>Agda is a constructive mathematical system by default, which amounts
to saying that it can also be considered as a programming
language. But we can assume the axiom of choice or the principle of
excluded middle for pieces of mathematics that require them, at the
cost of losing the implicit programming-language character of the system.
For a fully constructive development of univalent mathematics in
Agda, we would need to use its new <a href="https://homotopytypetheory.org/2018/12/06/cubical-agda/">cubical flavour</a>, and
we hope these notes provide a base for researchers interested in
learning Cubical Type Theory and Cubical Agda as the next step.</p>

<h3 id="-introduction"><a name="introduction"></a> Introduction</h3>

<p>A univalent type theory is the underlying formal system for a
foundation of univalent mathematics as conceived by <a href="http://www.math.ias.edu/Voevodsky/">Voevodsky</a>.</p>

<p>In the same way as there isn’t just one set theory (we have e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zermelo%E2%80%93Fraenkel_set_theory">ZFC</a>
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann%E2%80%93Bernays%E2%80%93G%C3%B6del_set_theory">NBG</a> among others), there isn’t just one univalent type theory (we
have e.g. the underlying type theory used in <a href="https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath">UniMath</a>, <a href="https://homotopytypetheory.org/2015/01/07/the-hott-book-does-not-define-hott/">HoTT-book type
theory</a>, and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.02108">cubical type theory</a>, among others, and more are expected
to come in the foreseeable future before the foundations of univalent
mathematics stabilize).</p>

<p>The salient differences between univalent mathematics and traditional,
set-based mathematics may be shocking at first sight:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The kinds of objects we take as basic.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Certain things called types, or higher-groupoids, rather than sets, are the primitive objects.</li>
      <li>Sets, also called 0-groupoids, are particular kinds of types.</li>
      <li>So we have more general objects as a starting point.</li>
      <li>E.g. the type <code class="highlighter-rouge">ℕ</code> of natural numbers is a set, and this is a theorem, not a definition.</li>
      <li>E.g. the type of monoids is not a set, but instead a <code class="highlighter-rouge">1</code>-groupoid, automatically.</li>
      <li>E.g. the type of categories is a <code class="highlighter-rouge">2</code>-groupoid, again automatically.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The treatment of logic.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Mathematical statements are interpreted as types rather than truth values.</li>
      <li>Truth values are particular kinds of types, called <code class="highlighter-rouge">-1</code>-groupoids, with at most one element.</li>
      <li>Logical operations are particular cases of mathematical operations on types.</li>
      <li>The mathematics comes first, with logic as a derived concept.</li>
      <li>E.g. when we say “and”, we are taking the cartesian product of two types, which may or may not be truth values.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The treatment of equality.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The value of an equality <code class="highlighter-rouge">x ≡ y</code> is a type, called the <em>identity type</em>, which is not necessarily a truth value.</li>
      <li>It collects the ways in which the mathematical objects <code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">y</code> are identified.</li>
      <li>E.g. it is a truth value for elements of <code class="highlighter-rouge">ℕ</code>, as there is at most one way for two natural numbers to be equal.</li>
      <li>E.g. for the <a href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#magmasandmonoids">type of monoids</a>, it is a set, amounting to the type of monoid isomorphisms, automatically.</li>
      <li>E.g. for the type of categories, it is a <code class="highlighter-rouge">1</code>-groupoid, amounting to the type of equivalences of categories, again automatically.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The important word in the above description of univalent foundations
is <em>automatic</em>. For example, we don’t <em>define</em> equality of monoids to
be isomorphism. Instead, we define the collection of monoids as the
large type of small types that are sets, equipped with a binary
multiplication operation and a unit satisfying associativity of
multiplication and neutrality of the unit in the usual way, and then
we <em>prove</em> that the native notion of equality that comes with
univalent type theory (inherited from Martin-Löf type theory) happens
to coincide with monoid isomorphism. Largeness and smallness are taken
as relative concepts, with type <em>universes</em> incorporated in the theory
to account for this distinction.</p>

<p>Voevodsky’s way to achive this is to start with a Martin-Löf type
theory (MLTT), including identity types and type universes, and
postulate a single axiom, named <em>univalence</em>. This axiom stipulates a
<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Canonical.html">canonical</a> bijection
between <em>type equivalences</em> (in a suitable sense defined by Voevodsky
in type theory) and type identifications (in the original sense of
Martin-Löf’s identity type). Voevodsky’s notion of type equivalence,
formulated in MLTT, is a refinement of the notion of isomorphism,
which works uniformly for all higher groupoids, i.e. types.</p>

<p>In particular, Voevodsky didn’t design a new type theory, but instead
gave an axiom for an existing type theory (or any of a family of
possible type theories, to be more precise).</p>

<p>The main <em>technical</em> contributions in type theory by Voevodsky are:</p>

<ol start="4">
   <li>The definition of type levels in MLTT, classifying them as n-groupoids including the possibility n=∞.</li>
   <li>The (simple and elegant) definition of type equivalence that works uniformly for all type levels in MLTT.</li>
   <li> The formulation of the univalence axiom in MLTT.</li>
</ol>

<p>Univalent mathematics begins within MLTT with (4) and (5) before we
postulate univalence. In fact, as the reader will see, we will do a
fair amount of univalent mathematics before we formulate or assume the
univalence axiom.</p>

<p>All of (4)-(6) crucially rely on Martin-Löf’s identity
type. Initially, Voevodsky thought that a new concept would be needed
in the type theory to achieve (4)-(6) and hence (1) and (3) above. But
he eventually discovered that Martin-Löf’s identity type is precisely
what he needed.</p>

<p>It may be considered somewhat miraculous that the addition of the
univalence axiom alone to MLTT can achieve (1) and (3). Martin-Löf
type theory was designed to achieve (2), and, regarding (1), types
were imagined/conceived as sets (and even named <em>sets</em> in some of the
original expositions by Martin-Löf), and, regarding (3), the identity
type was imagined/conceived as having at most one element, even if
MLTT cannot prove or disprove this statement, as was eventually
shown by
<a href="https://www.tcs.ifi.lmu.de/mitarbeiter/martin-hofmann">Hofmann</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Streicher">Streicher</a> with their
<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/316071">groupoid model of types</a>
in the early 1990’s.</p>

<p>Another important aspect of univalent mathematics is the presence of
explicit mechanisms for distinguishing</p>

<ol start="7">
 <li>property (e.g. an unspecified thing exists),</li>
 <li>data or structure (e.g. a designated thing exists or is given),</li>
</ol>

<p>which are common place in current mathematical practice
(e.g. cartesian closedness of a category is a property in some sense
(up to isomorphism), whereas monoidal closedness is given structure).</p>

<p>In summary, univalent mathematics is characterized by (1)-(8) and not
by the univalence axiom alone. In fact, 3/4 of theses notes begin
<em>without</em> the univalence axiom (as measured by the number of lines in
the source code for these lecture notes until we formulate the
univalence axiom and start to use it).</p>

<p>Lastly, univalent type theories don’t assume the axiom of choice or
the principle of excluded middle, and so in some sense they are
constructive by default. But we emphasize that these two axioms are
consistent and hence can be safely used as assumptions. However,
virtually all theorems of univalent mathematics, e.g. in
<a href="https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath/blob/master/README.md">UniMath</a>,
have been proved without assuming them, with natural mathematical
arguments. The formulations of theses principles in univalent
mathematics differ from their traditional formulations in MLTT, and
hence we sometimes refer to them as the <em>univalent</em> principle of
excluded middle and the <em>univalent</em> axiom of choice.</p>

<p>In these notes we will explore the above ideas, using Agda to write
MLTT definitions, constructions, theorems and proofs, with
univalence as an explicit assumption each time it is needed. We will
have a further assumption, the existence of certain subsingleton (or
propositional, or truth-value) truncations in order to be able to deal
with the distinction between property and data, and in particular with
the distinction between designated and unspecified existence (for
example to be able to define the notions of image of a function and of
surjective function). However, we will not assume them globally, so
that the students can see clearly when univalence or truncation are or
are not needed. In fact, the foundational definitions, constructions,
theorems and proofs of univalent mathematics don’t require univalence
or propositional truncation, and so can be developed in a version of
the original Martin-Löf type theories, and this is what happens in
these notes, and what Voevodsky did in his brilliant <a href="https://github.com/UniMath/Foundations">original
development in the computer system
Coq</a>. Our use of Agda, rather
than Coq, is a personal matter of taste only, and the students are
encouraged to learn Coq, too.</p>

<h4 id="-homotopy-type-theory"><a name="homotopytypetheory"></a> Homotopy type theory</h4>

<p>Univalent type theory is often called <em>homotopy type theory</em>.  Here we
are following Voevodsky, who coined the phrases <em>univalent
foundations</em> and <em>univalent mathematics</em>.
We regard the terminology <em>homotopy type theory</em> as probably more
appropriate for referring to the <em>synthetic</em> development of homotopy
theory within univalent mathematics, for which we refer the reader to
the <a href="https://homotopytypetheory.org/book/">HoTT book</a>.</p>

<p>However, the terminlogy <em>homotopy type theory</em> is also used as a
synonym for univalent type theory, not only because univalent type
theory has a model in homotopy types (as defined in homotopy theory),
but also because, without considering models, types do behave like
homotopy types, automatically. We will not discuss how to do homotopy
theory using univalent type theory in these notes. We refer the reader
to the HoTT book as a starting point.</p>

<p>A common compromise is to refer to the subject as <a href="https://cas.oslo.no/hott-uf/">HoTT/UF</a>.</p>

<h3 id="-what-is-agda"><a name="whatisagda"></a> What is Agda?</h3>

<p>There are <a href="https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/what-is-agda.html">two views</a>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Agda is a dependently-typed functional programming language.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Agda is a language for defining mathematical notions (e.g. group
or topological space), formulating constructions to be performed
(e.g. a type of real numbers, a group structure on the integers, a
topology on the reals), formulating theorems (e.g. a certain
construction is indeed a group structure, there are infinitely
many primes), and proving theorems (e.g. the infinitude of the
collection of primes with Euclid’s argument).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>This doesn’t mean that Agda has two sets of features, one for (1) and
the other for (2). The same set of features account simultaneously for
(1) and (2). Programs are mathematical constructions that happen not
to use non-constructive principles such as excluded middle.</p>

<p>In these notes we study a minimal univalent type theory and do
mathematics with it using a minimal subset of the computer language Agda
as a vehicle.</p>

<p>Agda allows one to construct proofs interactively, but we will not
discuss how to do this in these notes. Agda is not an automatic
theorem prover. We have to come up with our own proofs, which Agda
checks for correctness. We do get some form of interactive help to
input our proofs and render them as formal objects.</p>

<h3 id="-a-spartan-martin-löf-type-theory-mltt"><a name="spartanmltt"></a> A spartan Martin-Löf type theory (MLTT)</h3>

<p>Before embarking into a full definition of our Martin-Löf type
theory in Agda, we summarize the particular Martin-Löf type
theory that we will consider, by naming the concepts that we will
include. We will have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>An empty type <a href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#emptytype"><code class="highlighter-rouge">𝟘</code></a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A one-element type <a href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#onepointtype"><code class="highlighter-rouge">𝟙</code></a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A type of <a href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#naturalnumbers"><code class="highlighter-rouge">ℕ</code></a> natural numbers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Type formers <a href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#binarysum"><code class="highlighter-rouge">+</code></a> (binary sum),
<a href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#pitypes"><code class="highlighter-rouge">Π</code></a> (product),
<a href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#sigmatypes"><code class="highlighter-rouge">Σ</code></a> (sum),
<a href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#identitytype"><code class="highlighter-rouge">Id</code></a> (identity type).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#universes">Universes</a> (types of types), ranged
over by <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝓤,𝓥,𝓦</code>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This is enough to do number theory, analysis, group theory, topology, category theory and more.</p>

<p>spartan
  /ˈspɑːt(ə)n/
  adjective:</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>  showing or characterized by austerity or a lack of comfort or
  luxury.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We will also be rather spartan with the subset of Agda that we choose
to discuss. Many things we do here can be written in more concise ways
using more advanced features. Here we introduce a minimal
subset of Agda where everything in our spartan MLTT can be expressed.</p>

<h3 id="-universes"><a name="universes"></a> Universes</h3>

<p>A universe <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝓤</code> is a type of types.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>One use of universes is to define families of types indexed by a
type <code class="highlighter-rouge">X</code> as functions <code class="highlighter-rouge">X → 𝓤</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Such a function is <a href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#twinprime">sometimes</a> seen as a property of elements of <code class="highlighter-rouge">X</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another use of universes, as we shall see, is to define types of
mathematical structures, such as
<a href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#magmasandmonoids">monoids</a>, groups, topological
spaces, categories etc.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Sometimes we need more than one universe. For example, the type of
groups in a universe lives in a bigger universe, and given a category
in one universe, its presheaf category also lives in a larger universe.</p>

<p>We will work with a tower of type universes</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">𝓤₀, 𝓤₁, 𝓤₂, 𝓤₃, ...</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>These are actually universe names (also called levels, not to be confused with <a href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#hlevel">hlevels</a>). We reference
the universes themselves by a deliberately almost-invisible
superscript dot. For example, we will have</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">𝟙 : 𝓤₀ ̇</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>where <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝟙</code> is the one-point type to be defined shortly. We will sometimes
omit this superscript in our discussions, but are forced to write it
in Agda code. We have that the universe <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝓤₀</code> is a type in the universe
<code class="highlighter-rouge">𝓤₁</code>, which is a type in the universe 𝓤₂ and so on.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">𝓤₀ ̇</code>       <code class="highlighter-rouge">: 𝓤₁ ̇</code></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">𝓤₁ ̇</code>       <code class="highlighter-rouge">: 𝓤₂ ̇</code></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">𝓤₂ ̇</code>       <code class="highlighter-rouge">: 𝓤₃ ̇</code></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">       ⋮ </code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The assumption that <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝓤₀ : 𝓤₀</code> or that any universe is in itself or a
smaller universe <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF01995104">gives rise to a
contradiction</a>,
similar to <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/russell-paradox/">Russell’s
Paradox</a>.</p>

<p>Given a universe <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝓤</code>, we denote by</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">𝓤 ⁺</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>its successor universe. For example, if <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝓤</code> is <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝓤₀</code> then <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝓤 ⁺</code> is
<code class="highlighter-rouge">𝓤₁</code>. The least upper bound of two universes <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝓤</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝓥</code> is written</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">𝓤 ⊔ 𝓥</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For example, if <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝓤</code> is <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝓤₀</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝓥</code> is <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝓤₁</code>, then <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝓤 ⊔ 𝓥</code> is <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝓤₁</code>.</p>

<p>We now bring our notation for universes by importing our Agda file
<a href="Universes.html"><code class="highlighter-rouge">Universes</code></a>. The Agda keyword
<a href="https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language/module-system.html"><code class="highlighter-rouge">open</code></a>
asks to make all definitions in the file <code class="highlighter-rouge">Universe</code> visible in our
file here. The Agda code in these notes has syntax highlighting and
html links, so that we can navigate to other modules, such as
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Universe</code> or to definitions in this file.</p>

<pre class="Agda">

<h3 id="-the-one-element-type-𝟙"><a name="onepointtype"></a> The one-element type <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝟙</code></h3>

<p>We place it in the first universe, and we name its unique element
“<code class="highlighter-rouge">⋆</code>”. We use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">data</code> declaration in Agda to introduce it:</p>

<pre class="Agda">
<a id="27634" class="Keyword">data</a> <a id="𝟙"></a><a id="27639" href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#27639" class="Datatype">𝟙</a> <a id="27641" class="Symbol">:</a> <a id="27643" href="Universes.html#611" class="Primitive">𝓤₀</a> <a id="27646" href="Universes.html#1905" class="Function Operator">̇</a>  <a id="27649" class="Keyword">where</a>
 <a id="𝟙.⋆"></a><a id="27656" href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#27656" class="InductiveConstructor">⋆</a> <a id="27658" class="Symbol">:</a> <a id="27660" href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#27639" class="Datatype">𝟙</a>
</pre>

<p>It is important that the point <code class="highlighter-rouge">⋆</code> lives in the type <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝟙</code> and in no other
type. There isn’t dual citizenship in our type theory. When we create
a type, we also create freshly new elements for it, in this case
“<code class="highlighter-rouge">⋆</code>”. (However, Agda has a limited form of overloading, which allows
us to sometimes use the same name for different things.)</p>

<p>Next we want to give a mechanism to prove that all points of the
type <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝟙</code> satify a given property <code class="highlighter-rouge">A</code>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The property is a function <code class="highlighter-rouge">A : 𝟙 → 𝓤</code> for some universe <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝓤</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The type <code class="highlighter-rouge">A(x)</code>, which we will write simply <code class="highlighter-rouge">A x</code>, doesn’t need to
be a <a href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#subsingletonsandsets">truth value</a>.  It can be
any type. We will meet examples shortly.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mathematical statements are types, such as</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Π (A : 𝟙 → 𝓤), A ⋆ → Π (x : 𝟙), A x</code>.</p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We read this in natural language as “for any given property <code class="highlighter-rouge">A</code> of
elements of the type <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝟙</code>, if <code class="highlighter-rouge">A ⋆</code> holds, then it follows that <code class="highlighter-rouge">A
x</code> holds for all <code class="highlighter-rouge">x : 𝟙</code>”.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In Agda above <code class="highlighter-rouge">Π</code> type is written as</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">(A : 𝟙 → 𝓤 ̇ ) → A ⋆ → (x : 𝟙) → A x</code>.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>This is the type of functions with three arguments <code class="highlighter-rouge">A : 𝟙 → 𝓤 ̇</code>  
and <code class="highlighter-rouge">a : A ⋆</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">x : 𝟙</code>, with values in the type <code class="highlighter-rouge">A x</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A proof of a mathematical statement rendered as a type is a
construction of an element of the type.  In our example, we have
to construct a function, which we will name <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝟙-induction</code>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>We do this as follows in Agda, where we first declare the type of the
function <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝟙-induction</code> with “<code class="highlighter-rouge">:</code>” and then define the function by an
equation:</p>

<pre class="Agda">
<a id="𝟙-induction"></a><a id="29229" href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#29229" class="Function">𝟙-induction</a> <a id="29241" class="Symbol">:</a> <a id="29243" class="Symbol">(</a><a id="29244" href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#29244" class="Bound">A</a> <a id="29246" class="Symbol">:</a> <a id="29248" href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#27639" class="Datatype">𝟙</a> <a id="29250" class="Symbol">→</a> <a id="29252" href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#27342" class="Generalizable">𝓤</a> <a id="29254" href="Universes.html#1905" class="Function Operator">̇</a> <a id="29256" class="Symbol">)</a>

<a id="29292" href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#29229" class="Function">𝟙-induction</a> <a id="29304" href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#29304" class="Bound">A</a> <a id="29306" href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#29306" class="Bound">a</a> <a id="29308" href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#27656" class="InductiveConstructor">⋆</a> <a id="29310" class="Symbol">=</a> <a id="29312" href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#29306" class="Bound">a</a>
</pre>

<p>Notice that we supply <code class="highlighter-rouge">A</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">a</code> as arbitrary arguments, but instead of
an arbitrary <code class="highlighter-rouge">x : 𝟙</code> we have written “<code class="highlighter-rouge">⋆</code>”. Agda accepts this because it
knows from the definition of <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝟙</code> that “<code class="highlighter-rouge">⋆</code>” is the only element of the
type <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝟙</code>. This mechanism is called <em>pattern matching</em>.</p>

<p>A particular case of <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝟙-induction</code> occurs when the family <code class="highlighter-rouge">A</code> is constant
with value <code class="highlighter-rouge">B</code>, which can be written variously as <code class="highlighter-rouge">A = λ (x : 𝟙) → B</code>,
or <code class="highlighter-rouge">A = λ x → B</code> if we want Agda to figure out the type of <code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code> by itself,
or <code class="highlighter-rouge">A = λ _ → B</code> if we don’t want to name the argument of <code class="highlighter-rouge">A</code> because it
is not used. In usual mathematical practice, such a <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/lambda-calculus/">lambda expression</a> is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(mathematics)#Arrow_notation">often
written</a> <code class="highlighter-rouge">x ↦ B</code> (<code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code> is mapped to <code class="highlighter-rouge">B</code>) and so <code class="highlighter-rouge">A = (x ↦ B)</code>.
Given a type <code class="highlighter-rouge">B</code> and a point <code class="highlighter-rouge">b : B</code>, we construct the function <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝟙 → B</code>
that maps any given <code class="highlighter-rouge">x : 𝟙</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">b</code>.</p>

<p>Not all types have to be seen as mathematical statements (for example
the type <code class="highlighter-rouge">ℕ</code> of natural numbers defined below). But the above definition
has a dual interpretation as a mathematical function, and as the
statement “<code class="highlighter-rouge">B</code> implies (<em>true</em> implies <code class="highlighter-rouge">B</code>)” where <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝟙</code> is the type encoding
the truth value <em>true</em>.</p>

<p>The unique function to <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝟙</code> will be named <code class="highlighter-rouge">!𝟙</code>. We define two versions
to illustrate <a href="https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language/implicit-arguments.html">implicit
arguments</a>,
which correspond in mathematics to “subscripts that are omitted when
the reader can safely infer them”, as for example for the identity
function of a set or the identity arrow of an object of a category.</p>

<p>This means that when we write <code class="highlighter-rouge">!𝟙 x</code> we have to recover the (uniquely
determined) missing type <code class="highlighter-rouge">X</code> with <code class="highlighter-rouge">x : X</code> “from the context”. When
Agda can’t figure it out, we need to supply it and write <code class="highlighter-rouge">!𝟙 {𝓤} {X}
x</code>. This is because <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝓤</code> is also an implicit argument (all things
declared with the Agda keyword <em>variable</em> <a href="https://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~mhe/HoTT-UF-in-Agda-Lecture-Notes/index.html#universes">as above</a> are implicit
arguments). There are
<a href="https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language/implicit-arguments.html">other</a>,
non-positional, ways to indicate <code class="highlighter-rouge">X</code> without having to indicate <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝓤</code>
too. Occasionally, people define variants of a function with different
choices of “implicitness”, as above.</p>

<p>That’s the complete definition. This has a dual interpretation,
mathematically as the empty set (we can actually prove that this type

logically as the truth value <em>false</em>. To prove that a property of

have to do nothing.</p>

<p>When we write the pattern <code class="highlighter-rouge">()</code>, Agda checks if there is any case we
missed. If there is none, our definition is accepted.  The expression

<p>This says that a type is empty precisely when we have a function to
the empty type. Assuming <a href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#univalence">univalence</a>,
once we have defined the equality type former
<a href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#identitytype"><code class="highlighter-rouge">_≡_</code></a>, we will be able to prove that
<code class="highlighter-rouge">(is-empty X) ≡ (X ≃ 𝟘)</code>, where <code class="highlighter-rouge">X ≃ 𝟘</code> is the type of bijections, or
<a href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#fibersandequivalences">equivalences</a>, from <code class="highlighter-rouge">X</code> to
<code class="highlighter-rouge">𝟘</code>. We will also be able to prove things like <code class="highlighter-rouge">(2 + 2 ≡ 5) ≡ 𝟘</code> and
<code class="highlighter-rouge">(2 + 2 ≡ 4) ≡ 𝟙</code>.</p>

<p>This is for <em>numbers</em>. If we define <em>types</em> <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝟚 = 𝟙 + 𝟙</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝟜 = 𝟚 +
𝟚</code> with two and four elements respectively, where we are anticipating
the definition of <a href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#binarysum"><code class="highlighter-rouge">_+_</code></a> for types, then we
will instead have that <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝟚 + 𝟚 ≡ 𝟜</code> is a type with <code class="highlighter-rouge">4!</code> elements, which
is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factorial">number of permutations</a>
of a set with four elements, rather than a truth value <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝟘</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝟙</code>, as
a consequence of the univalence axiom. That is, we will have <code class="highlighter-rouge">(𝟚 + 𝟚 ≡
𝟜) ≃ (𝟜 + 𝟜 + 𝟜 + 𝟜 + 𝟜 + 𝟜)</code>, so that the type equality <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝟚 + 𝟚 ≡ 𝟜</code>
holds in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/math/9802029">many more ways</a> than the
numerical equation <code class="highlighter-rouge">2 + 2 ≡ 4</code>.</p>

<p>The above is possible only because universes are genuine types and
hence their elements (that is, types) have identity types themselves,
so that writing <code class="highlighter-rouge">X ≡ Y</code> for types <code class="highlighter-rouge">X</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Y</code> (inhabiting the same
universe) is allowed.</p>

<p>When we view <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝟘</code> as <em>false</em>, we can read the definition of
the <em>negation</em> <code class="highlighter-rouge">¬ X</code> as saying that “<code class="highlighter-rouge">X</code> implies <em>false</em>”. With univalence
we will be able to show that “(<em>false</em> → <em>false</em>) <code class="highlighter-rouge">≡</code> <em>true</em>”, which amounts
to <code class="highlighter-rouge">(𝟘 → 𝟘) ≡ 𝟙</code>, which in turn says that there is precisely one function
<code class="highlighter-rouge">𝟘 → 𝟘</code>, namely the (vacuous) identity function.</p>

<p>The definition is similar but not quite the same as the one via
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peano_axioms">Peano Axioms</a>.</p>

<p>We stipulate an element <code class="highlighter-rouge">zero : ℕ</code> and a successor function <code class="highlighter-rouge">ℕ → ℕ</code>,
and then define induction. Once we have defined equality <code class="highlighter-rouge">_≡_</code>, we
will <a href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#naturalsset"><em>prove</em></a> the other peano axioms.</p>

<p>In general, declarations with <code class="highlighter-rouge">data</code> are inductive definitions. To write the number <code class="highlighter-rouge">5</code>, we have to write</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">succ (succ (succ (succ (succ zero))))</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We can use the following Agda
<a href="https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language/pragmas.html"><em>pragma</em></a>
to be able to just write <code class="highlighter-rouge">5</code> as a shorthand:</p>

<pre class="Agda">

</pre>

<p>Apart from this notational effect, the above pragma doesn’t play any
role in the Agda development of these lectures notes.</p>

<p>In the following, the type family <code class="highlighter-rouge">A</code> can be seen as playing the role
of a property of elements of <code class="highlighter-rouge">ℕ</code>, except that it doesn’t need to be
necessarily
<a href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#subsingletonsandsets">subsingleton</a>-valued. When it
is, the <em>type</em> of the function gives the familiar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_induction">principle of
mathematical
induction</a> for
natural numbers, whereas, in general, its definition says how to
compute with induction.</p>

<p>The definition of <code class="highlighter-rouge">ℕ-induction</code> is itself by induction. It says that given a point <code class="highlighter-rouge">a₀ : A 0</code> and a function <code class="highlighter-rouge">f : (n : ℕ) → A n → A (succ n)</code>, in order to calculate an element of <code class="highlighter-rouge">A n</code> for a given <code class="highlighter-rouge">n : ℕ</code>, we just calculate <code class="highlighter-rouge">h n</code>, that is,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">f n (f (n-1) (f (n-2) (... (f 0 a₀)...)))</code>.</p>

<p>So the principle of induction is a construction that given a <em>base
case</em> <code class="highlighter-rouge">a₀ : A 0</code>, an <em>induction step</em> <code class="highlighter-rouge">f : (n : ℕ) → A n → A (succ n)</code> and a number <code class="highlighter-rouge">n</code>, says how to get
an element of the type <code class="highlighter-rouge">A n</code> by <a href="https://www.encyclopediaofmath.org/index.php/Primitive_recursion">primitive
recursion</a>.</p>

<p>Notice also that <code class="highlighter-rouge">ℕ-induction</code> is the dependently typed version of
primitive recursion, where the non-dependently type version is</p>

<p>Agda checks that any recursive definition as above is well founded,
with recursive invokations with structurally smaller arguments
only. If it isn’t, the definition is not accepted.</p>

<p>In official Martin-Löf type theories, we have to use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ℕ-induction</code>
functional to define everything else with the natural numbers. But Agda
allows us to define functions by structural recursion, like we defined
<code class="highlighter-rouge">ℕ-induction</code>.</p>

<p>We now define addition and multiplication for the sake of illustration.
We first do it in Peano style. We will create a local <a href="https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language/module-system.html#"><code class="highlighter-rouge">module</code></a> so that the
definitions are not globally visible, as we want to have the symbols
<code class="highlighter-rouge">+</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">×</code> free for type operations of MLTT to be defined soon. The
things in the module are indented and are visible outside the module
only if we <a href="https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language/module-system.html#"><code class="highlighter-rouge">open</code></a> the module or if we write them as
e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">Arithmetic.+</code> in the following example.</p>

<p>The above <code class="highlighter-rouge">infix</code> operations allow us to indicate the precedences
(multiplication has higher precedence than addition) and their
associativity (here we take left-associativity as the convention, so that

<p>Here the expression “<code class="highlighter-rouge">x +_</code>” stands for the function <code class="highlighter-rouge">ℕ → ℕ</code> that adds
<code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code> to its argument. So to multiply <code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code> by <code class="highlighter-rouge">y</code>, we apply <code class="highlighter-rouge">y</code> times the
function “<code class="highlighter-rouge">x +_</code>” to <code class="highlighter-rouge">0</code>.</p>

<p>As another example, we define the less-than-or-equal relation by
nested induction, on the first argument and then the second, but we
use pattern

<p>When the types <code class="highlighter-rouge">A</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">B</code> are understood as mathematical statements,
the type <code class="highlighter-rouge">A + B</code> is understood as the statement “<code class="highlighter-rouge">A</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">B</code>”, because
to prove “<code class="highlighter-rouge">A</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">B</code>” we have to prove one of <code class="highlighter-rouge">A</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">B</code>. When <code class="highlighter-rouge">A</code> and
<code class="highlighter-rouge">B</code> are simultaneously possible, we have two proofs, but sometimes we
want to deliberately ignore which one we get, when we want to get a
truth value rather than a possibly more general type, and in this case
we use the <a href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#truncation">truncation</a> <code class="highlighter-rouge">∥ A + B ∥</code>.</p>

<p>But also <code class="highlighter-rouge">_+_</code> is used to construct mathematical objects. For example,
we can define a two-point type:</p>

<pre class="Agda">
<a id="𝟚"></a><a id="42618" href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#42618" class="Function">𝟚</a> <a id="42620" class="Symbol">:</a> <a id="42622" href="Universes.html#611" class="Primitive">𝓤₀</a> <a id="42625" href="Universes.html#1905" class="Function Operator">̇</a>

</pre>

<p>We can name the left and right points as follows, using patterns, so
that they can be used in pattern matching:</p>

<pre class="Agda">
<a id="42775" class="Keyword">pattern</a> <a id="₀"></a><a id="42783" href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#42783" class="InductiveConstructor">₀</a> <a id="42785" class="Symbol">=</a> <a id="42787" href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#41513" class="InductiveConstructor">inl</a> <a id="42791" href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#27656" class="InductiveConstructor">⋆</a>

<p>because <code class="highlighter-rouge">Y = λ (x : X) → Y x</code> by a so-called η-rule. However, we will
often use the synonym <code class="highlighter-rouge">\</code> of <code class="highlighter-rouge">λ</code> for <code class="highlighter-rouge">Σ</code>, as if considering it as part
of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Σ</code> syntax.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Σ \(x : X) → Y x</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In MLTT we would write this as <code class="highlighter-rouge">Σ (x : X), Y x</code> or
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summation">similar</a>, for example with
the indexing <code class="highlighter-rouge">x : X</code> written as a subscript of <code class="highlighter-rouge">Σ</code> or under it.</p>

<p>Or it may be that the name <code class="highlighter-rouge">Y</code> is not defined, and we work with a
nameless family defined on the fly, as in the exercise proposed above:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Σ \(z : ℕ) → x + z ≡ y</code>,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>where <code class="highlighter-rouge">Y z = (x + z ≡ y)</code> in this case, and where we haven’t defined
the <a href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#identitytype">identity type former</a> <code class="highlighter-rouge">_≡_</code> yet.</p>

<p>We can construct the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Σ</code> type former as follows in Agda:</p>

<p>This says we are defining a binary operator <code class="highlighter-rouge">_,_</code> to construct the
elements of this type as <code class="highlighter-rouge">x , y</code>. The brackets are not needed, but we
will often write them to get the more familiar notation <code class="highlighter-rouge">(x , y)</code>. The
definition says that an element of <code class="highlighter-rouge">Σ Y</code> has two <code class="highlighter-rouge">fields</code>, giving the
types for them.</p>

<p><em>Remark.</em> Beginners may safely ignore this remark: Normally people
will call these two fields something like <code class="highlighter-rouge">pr₁</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">pr₂</code>, or <code class="highlighter-rouge">fst</code>
and <code class="highlighter-rouge">snd</code>, for first and second projection, rather than <code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">y</code>,
and then do <code class="highlighter-rouge">open Σ public</code> and have the projections available as
functions automatically. But we will deliberately not do that, and
instead define the projections ourselves, because this is confusing
for beginners, no matter how mathematically or computationally versed
they may be, in particular because it will not be immediately clear
that the projections have the following types.</p>

<p>We have seen by way of examples that the function type symbol <code class="highlighter-rouge">→</code>
represents logical implication, and that a dependent function type
<code class="highlighter-rouge">(x : X) → A x</code> represents a universal quantification.</p>

<p>We have the following uses of <code class="highlighter-rouge">Σ</code>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The binary cartesian product represents conjunction “and”. If the
types <code class="highlighter-rouge">A</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">B</code> stand for mathematical statements, then the mathematical
statement “<code class="highlighter-rouge">A</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">B</code>” is codified as <code class="highlighter-rouge">A × B</code>. This is because to prove
“<code class="highlighter-rouge">A</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">B</code>”, we have to provide a pair <code class="highlighter-rouge">(a , b)</code> of proofs <code class="highlighter-rouge">a : A</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">b : B</code>.</p>

    <p>So notice that in type theory, proofs are mathematical objects,
rather than meta-mathematical entities like in set theory. They are
just elements of types.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The more general type <code class="highlighter-rouge">Σ \(x : X), A x</code>, if the type <code class="highlighter-rouge">X</code> stands
for a mathematical object and <code class="highlighter-rouge">A</code> stands for a mathematical
statement, represents <em>designated</em> existence “there is a
designated <code class="highlighter-rouge">x : X</code> with <code class="highlighter-rouge">A x</code>”.  To prove this, we have to provide
a specific <code class="highlighter-rouge">x : X</code> and a proof <code class="highlighter-rouge">a : A x</code>, together in a pair <code class="highlighter-rouge">(x ,
a)</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Later we will discuss <em>unspecified</em> existence <code class="highlighter-rouge">∃ \(x : X) → A x</code>,
which will be obtained by a sort of quotient of <code class="highlighter-rouge">Σ \(x : X), A x</code>,
written <code class="highlighter-rouge">∥ Σ \(x : X), A x ∥</code> that identifies all the elements of
the type <code class="highlighter-rouge">Σ \(x : X), A x</code> in a single equivalence class, called
its propositional or subsingleton
<a href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#truncation">truncation</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another reading of <code class="highlighter-rouge">Σ \(x : X), A x</code> is as “the type of <code class="highlighter-rouge">x : X</code>
with <code class="highlighter-rouge">A x</code>”, similar to subset notation <code class="highlighter-rouge">{ x ∈ X | A x }</code> in set
theory. But have to be careful because if there is more than one
element in the type <code class="highlighter-rouge">A x</code>, then <code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code> is put more than once in this
type. In such situations, if we don’t want that, we have to be
careful and either ensure that the type <code class="highlighter-rouge">A x</code> has at most one
element for every <code class="highlighter-rouge">x : X</code>, or instead consider the truncated type
<code class="highlighter-rouge">∥ A x ∥</code> and write <code class="highlighter-rouge">Σ \(x : X), ∥ A x ∥</code>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Π</code> types are builtin with a different notation in Agda, as discussed

<p>Notice that the function type <code class="highlighter-rouge">X → Y</code> is the particular case of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">Π</code>
type when the family <code class="highlighter-rouge">A</code> is constant with value <code class="highlighter-rouge">Y</code>.</p>

<p>We take the opportunity to define the identity function (in two

<p>Usually the type of function composition <code class="highlighter-rouge">_∘_</code> is given as simply</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">(Y → Z) → (X → Y) → (X → Z)</code>.</p>

<p>With dependent functions, we can give it a more general type:</p>

<p>Notice that this type for the composition function can be read as a mathematical
statement: If <code class="highlighter-rouge">Z y</code> holds for all <code class="highlighter-rouge">y : Y</code>, then for any given <code class="highlighter-rouge">f : X →
Y</code> we have that <code class="highlighter-rouge">Z (f x)</code> holds for all <code class="highlighter-rouge">x : X</code>. And the non-dependent
one is just the transitivity of implication.</p>

<p>The following functions are sometimes useful when we are using
implicit arguments, in order to recover them explicitly without having
to list them as given arguments:</p>

<p>We now introduce the central type constructor of MLTT from the point
of view of univalent mathematics. In Agda we can define Martin-Löf’s
identity type as follows:</p>

<pre class="Agda">

</pre>

<p>Intuitively, the above definition would say that the only element
of the type <code class="highlighter-rouge">Id X x x</code> is something called <code class="highlighter-rouge">refl x</code> (for
reflexivity). But, as we shall see in a moment, this intuition turns
out to be incorrect.</p>

<p>Notice a crucial difference with the previous definitions using <code class="highlighter-rouge">data</code>
or induction: In the previous cases, we defined <em>types</em>, namely <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝟘</code>,
<code class="highlighter-rouge">𝟙</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">ℕ</code>, or a <em>type depending on type parameters</em>, namely <code class="highlighter-rouge">_+_</code>, with <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝓤</code>
and <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝓥</code> fixed,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">_+_ : 𝓤 ̇ → 𝓥 ̇ → 𝓤 ⊔ 𝓥 ̇</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But here we are defining a <em>type family</em> indexed by the <em>elements</em> of
a give type, rather than a new type from old types. Given a type <code class="highlighter-rouge">X</code>
in a universe <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝓤</code>, we define a <em>function</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Id X : X → X → 𝓤</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>by some mysterious sort of induction. It is this that prevents us from
being able to prove that <code class="highlighter-rouge">refl x</code> would be the only element of the type <code class="highlighter-rouge">Id
X x x</code>, or that for <code class="highlighter-rouge">Id X x y</code> would have at most one element no
matter what <code class="highlighter-rouge">y : X</code> is. There is however, one interesting, and crucial, thing we
<a href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#singleton-type">can prove</a>, namely that for any fixed <code class="highlighter-rouge">x : X</code>, the
type</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">Σ \(y : Y) → Id X x y</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>is always a <a href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#hlevel">singleton</a>.</p>

<p>We will use the following alternative notation for the identity type
former <code class="highlighter-rouge">Id</code>, where the symbol “<code class="highlighter-rouge">_</code>” in the right-hand side of the
definition indicates that we ask Agda to infer which type we are
talking about (which is <code class="highlighter-rouge">X</code>, but this name is not available in the
scope of the <em>definiting equation</em> of <code class="highlighter-rouge">_≡_</code>):</p>

<pre class="Agda">

</pre>

<p>Another intuition for this type family <code class="highlighter-rouge">_≡_ : X → X → 𝓤</code> is that it
gives the least reflexive relation on the type <code class="highlighter-rouge">X</code>, as indicated by
Martin-Löf’s induction principle <code class="highlighter-rouge">J</code> discussed below.</p>

<p>Whereas we can make the intuition that <code class="highlighter-rouge">x ≡ x</code> has precisely one
element good by postulating a certain <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/axiom+K+%28type+theory%29"><code class="highlighter-rouge">K</code>
axiom</a> due to
Thomas Streicher, which comes with Agda by default but we have
<a href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#gettingstartedagda">disabled above</a>, we cannot <em>prove</em> that <code class="highlighter-rouge">refl x</code>
is the only element of <code class="highlighter-rouge">x ≡ x</code> for an arbitrary type <code class="highlighter-rouge">X</code>. This
non-provability result was established by <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/316071">Hofmann and
Streicher</a>, by giving a
model of type theory in which types are interpreted as
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupoid"><code class="highlighter-rouge">1</code>-groupoids</a>.</p>

<p>However, for the elements of <em>some</em> types, such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">ℕ</code>, it is
<a href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#naturalsset">possible to prove</a> that any identity
type <code class="highlighter-rouge">x ≡ y</code> has at most one element. Such types are called <a href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#subsingletonsandsets">sets in
univalent mathematics</a>.</p>

<p>If instead of <code class="highlighter-rouge">K</code> we adopt Voevodsky’s
<a href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#univalence">univalence</a> axiom, we get <a href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#notsets">specific
examples</a> of objects <code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">y</code> such that
the type <code class="highlighter-rouge">x ≡ y</code> has multiple elements, <em>within</em> the type theory.  It
follows that the identity type <code class="highlighter-rouge">x ≡ y</code> is fairly under-specified in
general, in that we can’t prove or disprove that it has at most one
element.</p>

<p>There are two opposing ways to resolve the ambiguity or
underspecification of the identity types: (1) We can consider the <code class="highlighter-rouge">K</code>
axiom, which postulates that all types are sets, or (2) we can
consider the univalence axiom, arriving at univalent mathematics,
which gives rise to types that are more general than sets, the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">n</code>-groupoids and <code class="highlighter-rouge">∞</code>-groupoids.  In fact, the univalence axiom will
say, in particular, that for some types <code class="highlighter-rouge">X</code> and elements <code class="highlighter-rouge">x y : X</code>, the
identity type <code class="highlighter-rouge">x ≡ y</code> does have more than one element.</p>

<p>A possible way to understand the point <code class="highlighter-rouge">refl x</code> of the type <code class="highlighter-rouge">x ≡ x</code> is
as the “generic identification” between <code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code> and itself, but which is
by no means necessarily the <em>only</em> identitification in univalent
foundations. It is generic in the sense that to explain what happens
with all identifications <code class="highlighter-rouge">p : x ≡ y</code> between any two points <code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code> and
<code class="highlighter-rouge">y</code> of a type <code class="highlighter-rouge">X</code>, it suffices to explain what happens with the
identification <code class="highlighter-rouge">refl x : x ≡ x</code> for all points <code class="highlighter-rouge">x : X</code>. This
is what the induction principle for identity given by Martin-Löf says,
which he called <code class="highlighter-rouge">J</code> (we could have called it <code class="highlighter-rouge">≡-induction</code>, but we
prefer to honour MLTT tradition):</p>

<p>This is <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~mhe/yoneda/yoneda.html">related</a> to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoneda_lemma">Yoneda
Lemma</a> in category theory,
if you are familiar with this subject, which says that certain natural
transformations are <em>uniquely determined</em> by their <em>action on the
identity arrows</em>, even if they are <em>defined for all arrows</em>. Similarly
here, <code class="highlighter-rouge">J</code> is uniquely determined by its action on reflexive
identifications, but is <em>defined for all identifications between any
two points</em>, not just reflexivities.</p>

<p>In summary, Martin-Löf’s identity type is given by the data</p>

<ul>

  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">refl</code>,</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">J</code>,</li>
  <li>the above equation for <code class="highlighter-rouge">J</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, we will not always use this induction principle, because we
can instead work with the instances we need by pattern matching on
<code class="highlighter-rouge">refl</code> (which is just what we did to define the principle itself) and
there is a <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2628139">theorem by Jesper
Cockx</a> which says that
with the Agda option <code class="highlighter-rouge">without-K</code>, pattern matching on <code class="highlighter-rouge">refl</code> can

<p>Similarly define <code class="highlighter-rouge">H'</code> from <code class="highlighter-rouge">J</code> without using pattern matching on <code class="highlighter-rouge">refl</code>
and show that it coincides with <code class="highlighter-rouge">H</code> (possibly using pattern matching
on <code class="highlighter-rouge">refl</code>). This is
<a href="http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~coquand/singl.pdf">harder</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Notational remark.</strong> The symbols “<code class="highlighter-rouge">=</code>” and “<code class="highlighter-rouge">≡</code>” are swapped with
  respect to the <a href="https://homotopytypetheory.org/book/">HoTT book</a>
  convention for definitional/judgemental equality and typed-valued equality,
  and there is nothing we can do about that because “<code class="highlighter-rouge">=</code>” is a
  reserved Agda symbol for definitional equality. Irrespectively of
  this, it does make sense to use “<code class="highlighter-rouge">≡</code>” with a triple bar, if we
  understand this as indicating that there are multiple ways of
  identifying two things in general.</p>

<p>With this, we have concluded the rendering of our spartan MLTT in
Agda notation. Before embarking on the development of univalent
mathematics within our spartan MLTT, we pause to discuss some
basic examples of mathematics in Martin-Löf type theory.</p>

<p><em>Composition of identifications.</em>
Given two identifications <code class="highlighter-rouge">p : x ≡ y</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">q : y ≡ z</code>, we can compose them
to get an identification <code class="highlighter-rouge">p ∙ q : x ≡ z</code>. This can also be seen as
transitivity of equality. Because the type of composition doesn’t
mention <code class="highlighter-rouge">p</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">q</code>, we can use the non-dependent version of <code class="highlighter-rouge">≡</code>-induction.</p>

<p>Here we are considering the family <code class="highlighter-rouge">A t = (x ≡ t)</code>, and using the
identification <code class="highlighter-rouge">q : y ≡ z</code> to transport <code class="highlighter-rouge">A y</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">A z</code>, that is <code class="highlighter-rouge">x ≡
y</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">x ≡ z</code>.</p>

<p><em>Exercise.</em> define an alternative version that uses <code class="highlighter-rouge">p</code> to
transport. Can you prove that the two versions give equal results?</p>

<p>When writing <code class="highlighter-rouge">p ∙ q</code>, we lose information on the lhs and the rhs of the
identifications <code class="highlighter-rouge">p : x ≡ y</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">q : y ≡ z</code>, which makes some definitions hard to read. We now
introduce notation to be able to write e.g.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">x ≡⟨ p ⟩</code></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">y ≡⟨ q ⟩</code></p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">z ∎</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>as a synonym of the expression <code class="highlighter-rouge">p ∙ q</code> with some of the implicit arguments of <code class="highlighter-rouge">_∙_</code> made
explicit. We have one ternary <a href="https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language/mixfix-operators.html">mixfix</a> operator <code class="highlighter-rouge">_≡⟨_⟩_</code> and one unary
<code class="highlighter-rouge">postfix</code> operator <code class="highlighter-rouge">_∎</code>.</p>

<p>Here the symbol “<code class="highlighter-rouge">-</code>”, which is not to be confused with the symbol
“<code class="highlighter-rouge">_</code>”, is a variable. We will adopt the convention in these notes of
using this variable name “<code class="highlighter-rouge">-</code>” to make clear which part of an
expression we are replacing with <code class="highlighter-rouge">transport</code>.</p>

<p>Notice that we have so far used the recursion principle <code class="highlighter-rouge">transport</code>
only. To reason about <code class="highlighter-rouge">transport</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">_∙_</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">_⁻¹</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">ap</code>, we <a href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#identitytypeuf">will

<p><em>Pointwise equality of functions</em>. We will work with pointwise
equality of functions, defined as follows, which, using univalence,
will be <a href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#hfunext">equivalent to equality of functions</a>.</p>

<p>To prove that <code class="highlighter-rouge">A → ¬¬ A</code>, that is, <code class="highlighter-rouge">A → ((A → 𝟘) → 𝟘)</code>, we start with
a hypothetical element <code class="highlighter-rouge">a : A</code> and a hypothetical function <code class="highlighter-rouge">u : A → 𝟘</code>
and the goal is to get an element of <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝟘</code>. All we need to do is to
apply the function <code class="highlighter-rouge">u</code> to <code class="highlighter-rouge">a</code>. This gives double-negation

<p>Mathematically, this says that if we have a point of <code class="highlighter-rouge">A</code> (we say that
<code class="highlighter-rouge">A</code> is pointed) then <code class="highlighter-rouge">A</code> is nonempty. There is no general procedure to
implement the converse, that is, from a function <code class="highlighter-rouge">(A → 𝟘) → 𝟘</code> to get
a point of <code class="highlighter-rouge">A</code>. For <a href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#subsingletonsandsets">truth
values</a> <code class="highlighter-rouge">A</code>, we can assume
this as an axiom if we wish, because it is <a href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#appendix">equivalent to the
principle excluded middle</a>. For arbitrary types <code class="highlighter-rouge">A</code>,
this would be a form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_of_global_choice">global
choice</a> for type
theory.  However, global choice is inconsistent with univalence [<a href="https://homotopytypetheory.org/book/">HoTT
book</a>, Theorem 3.2.2], because
there is no way to choose an element of every non-empty type in a way
that is invariant under automorphisms. However, the <a href="Inhabitedness.html#choice">axiom of
choice</a> <em>is</em> consistent with univalent type
theory, as stated in the <a href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#introduction">introduction</a>.</p>

<p>In the proof of the following, we assume we are given hypothetical
functions <code class="highlighter-rouge">f : A → B</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">v : B → 𝟘</code>, and a hypothetical element <code class="highlighter-rouge">a :
A</code>, and our goal is to get an element of <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝟘</code>. But this is easy,
because <code class="highlighter-rouge">f a : B</code> and hence <code class="highlighter-rouge">v (f a) : 𝟘</code>.</p>

<p>We have given a logical name to this function. Mathematically, this
says that if we have a function <code class="highlighter-rouge">A → B</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">B</code> is empty, then <code class="highlighter-rouge">A</code>
must be empty, too. The proof is by assuming that <code class="highlighter-rouge">A</code> would have an
inhabitant <code class="highlighter-rouge">a</code>, to get a contradiction, namely that <code class="highlighter-rouge">B</code> would have an
inhabitant, too, showing that there can’t be any such inhabitant <code class="highlighter-rouge">a</code>
of <code class="highlighter-rouge">A</code> after all. See
<a href="http://math.andrej.com/2010/03/29/proof-of-negation-and-proof-by-contradiction/">Bauer</a>
for a general discussion.</p>

<p>And from this we get that three negations imply one:</p>

<blockquote>
    Proof. <em>Firstly</em>, since implication of the assertion &#119910; by the
    assertion &#119909; implies implication of absurdity of &#119909; by absurdity
    of &#119910;, the implication of <em>absurdity of absurdity</em> by <em>truth</em>
    (which is an established fact) implies the implication of
    <em>absurdity of truth</em>, that is to say of <em>absurdity</em>, by <em>absurdity

    implies absurdity of its absurdity, in particular truth of

<p><em>Remark.</em> Agda allows us to use a pattern <code class="highlighter-rouge">()</code> to get the following
quick proof.  However, this method of proof doesn’t belong to the
realm of MLTT. Hence we will use the pattern <code class="highlighter-rouge">()</code> only in the above
definition of <a href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#𝟘-induction"><code class="highlighter-rouge">𝟘-induction</code></a>.</p>

<p>So we consider four cases. In the first and the last, we have equal
things and so we give an answer in the left-hand side of the sum. In
the middle two, we give an answer in the right-hand side, where we need
functions <code class="highlighter-rouge">₀ ≡ ₁ → 𝟘</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">₁ ≡ ₀ → 𝟘</code>, which we can take to be <code class="highlighter-rouge">≢-sym
₁-is-not-₀</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">₁-is-not-₀</code> respectively.</p>

<p>The following is more interesting. We consider the two possible cases
for <code class="highlighter-rouge">n</code>. The first one assumes a hypothetical function <code class="highlighter-rouge">f : ₀ ≡ ₀ →
𝟘</code>, from which we get <code class="highlighter-rouge">f (refl ₀) : 𝟘</code>, and then, using <code class="highlighter-rouge">!𝟘</code>, we get
an element of any type we like, which we choose to be <code class="highlighter-rouge">₀ ≡ ₁</code>, and we
are done. Of course, we will never be able to use the function
<code class="highlighter-rouge">not-zero-is-one</code> with such outrageous arguments. The other case <code class="highlighter-rouge">n = ₁</code>
doesn’t need to use the hypothesis <code class="highlighter-rouge">f : ₁ ≡ ₀ → 𝟘</code>, because the
desired conclusion holds right away, as it is <code class="highlighter-rouge">₁ ≡ ₁</code>, which is proved
by <code class="highlighter-rouge">refl ₁</code>. But notice that there is nothing wrong with the
hypothesis <code class="highlighter-rouge">f : ₁ ≡ ₀ → 𝟘</code>. For example, we can use <code class="highlighter-rouge">not-zero-is-one</code>
with <code class="highlighter-rouge">n = ₀</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">f = ₁-is-not-₀</code>, so that the hypotheses can be
fulfilled in the second equation.</p>

<p>Thus, can we write down not only definitions, constructions, theorems
and proofs, but also conjectures. They are just definitions of
types. Likewise, the univalence axiom, <a href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#univalence">to be formulated in due course</a>,
is a type.</p>

<p>The type <code class="highlighter-rouge">Magma 𝓤</code> collects all magmas in a universe <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝓤</code>, and lives in
the successor universe <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝓤 ⁺</code>.  Thus, this doesn’t define what a magma is as
a property. It defines the type of magmas. A magma is an element of
this type, that is, a triple <code class="highlighter-rouge">(X , i , _·_)</code> with <code class="highlighter-rouge">X : 𝓤</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">i :
is-set X</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">_·_ : X → X → X</code>.</p>

<p>Given a magma <code class="highlighter-rouge">M = (X , i , _·_)</code> we denote by <code class="highlighter-rouge">⟨ M ⟩</code> its underlying
set <code class="highlighter-rouge">X</code> and by <code class="highlighter-rouge">magma-operation M</code> its multiplication <code class="highlighter-rouge">_·_</code>:</p>

<p>The following <a href="https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language/syntax-declarations.html">syntax declaration</a>
allows us to write <code class="highlighter-rouge">x ·⟨ M ⟩ y</code> as an abbreviation of <code class="highlighter-rouge">magma-operation M x y</code>:</p>

<pre class="Agda">
<a id="75933" class="Keyword">syntax</a> <a id="75940" href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#75628" class="Function">magma-operation</a> <a id="75956" class="Bound">M</a> <a id="75958" class="Bound">x</a> <a id="75960" class="Bound">y</a> <a id="75962" class="Symbol">=</a> <a id="75964" class="Bound">x</a> <a id="75966" class="Function">·⟨</a> <a id="75969" class="Bound">M</a> <a id="75971" class="Function">⟩</a> <a id="75973" class="Bound">y</a>

<p>For some reason, Agda has this kind of definition backwards: the
<em>definiendum</em> and the <em>definiens</em> are swapped with respect to the
normal convention of writing what is defined on the left-hand side of
the equality sign. In any case, the point is that this time we need
such a mechanism because in order to be able to mention arbitrary <code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code>
and <code class="highlighter-rouge">y</code>, we first need to know their types, which is <code class="highlighter-rouge">⟨ M ⟩</code> and hence
<code class="highlighter-rouge">M</code> has to occur before <code class="highlighter-rouge">x</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">y</code> in the definition of
<code class="highlighter-rouge">magma-operation</code>. The syntax declaration circumvents this.</p>

<p>A function of the underlying sets of two magmas is a called a
homomorphism when it commutes with the magma operations:</p>

<p><em>Remark.</em> People are more likely to use
<a href="https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language/record-types.html">records</a>
in Agda rather than iterated <code class="highlighter-rouge">Σ</code>s as above (<a href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#sigmatypes">recall</a> that we defined
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Σ</code> using a record). This is fine, because records amount to iterated
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Σ</code> types (<a href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#sigmatypes">recall</a> that also <code class="highlighter-rouge">_×_</code> is a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Σ</code> type, by
definition). Here, however, we are being deliberately spartan. Once we
have defined our Agda notation for MLTT, we want to stick to
it. This is for teaching purposes (of MLTT, encoded in Agda, not of
Agda itself in its full glory).</p>

<p>We could drop the <code class="highlighter-rouge">is-set X</code> condition, but then we wouldn’t get
<code class="highlighter-rouge">∞</code>-monoids in any reasonable sense. We would instead get “wild
<code class="highlighter-rouge">∞</code>-monoids” or “incoherent <code class="highlighter-rouge">∞</code>-monoids”. The reason is that in
monoids (with sets as carriers) the neutrality and associativity
equations can hold in at most one way, by definition of set. But if we
drop the set-hood requirement, then the equations can hold in multiple
ways. And then one is forced to consider equations between the
identifications (all the way up in the ∞-case), which is
what “<a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/coherence+law">coherence</a> data”
means. The wildness or incoherence amounts to the absence of such
data.</p>

<p>Similarly to the situation with magmas, identifications of monoids are
in bijection with monoid isomorphisms, assuming univalence. For this
to be the case, it is absolutely necessary that the carrier of a
monoid is a set rather than an arbitrary type, for otherwise the
monoid equations can hold in many possible ways, and we would need to
consider a notion of monoid isomorphism that in addition to preserving
the neutral element and the multiplication, preserves the equations, and
the preservations of the equations, and the preservation of the
preservations of the equations, <em>ad infinitum</em>.</p>

<p><em>Exercise.</em> Define the type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_(mathematics)">groups</a> (with sets as carriers).</p>

<p><em>Exercise.</em> Write down the various types of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_(mathematics)">categories</a>
defined in the HoTT book in Agda.</p>

<p><em>Exercise.</em> Try to define a type of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_space">topological
 spaces</a>.</p>

<p>We can view a type <code class="highlighter-rouge">X</code> as a sort of category with hom-types rather than
hom-sets, with composition defined as follows (and written in
so-called diagramatic order rather than the usual backwards order like
we wrote function composition).</p>

<p>If we wanted to prove the following without pattern matching, this
time we would need the dependent version <code class="highlighter-rouge">J</code> of induction on <code class="highlighter-rouge">_≡_</code>.</p>

<p><em>Exercise.</em> Try to do this with <code class="highlighter-rouge">J</code> and with <code class="highlighter-rouge">H</code>.</p>

<p>We have that <code class="highlighter-rouge">refl</code> provides a neutral element for composition of
identifications:</p>

<p>A category in which all arrows are invertible is called a
groupoid. The above is the basis for the Hofmann–Streicher groupoid
model of type theory.</p>

<p>But we actually get higher groupoids, because given
identifications</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">p q : x ≡ y</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>we can consider the identity type <code class="highlighter-rouge">p ≡ q</code>, and given</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">u v : p ≡ q</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>we can consider the type <code class="highlighter-rouge">u ≡ v</code>, and so on.
See [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/0812.0298">van den Berg and Garner</a>] and
[<a href="https://lmcs.episciences.org/1062">Lumsdaine</a>].</p>

<p>For some types, such as the natural numbers, we <a href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#naturalsset">can
prove</a> that this process trivializes
after the first step, because the type <code class="highlighter-rouge">x ≡ y</code> has at most one
element. Such types are the sets as defined above.</p>

<p>Voevodsky defined the notion of <a href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#hlevel"><em>hlevel</em></a>
to measure how long it takes for the process to trivialize.</p>

<p>Here are some more constructions with identifications:</p>

sense that is preserves the neutral element and commutes with

<p>Transport is also functorial with respect to identification
composition and function composition. By construction, it maps the
neutral element to the identity function. The apparent contravariance
takes place because we have defined function composition in the usual
order, but identification composition in diagramatic order (as is
customary in each case).</p>

<h3 id="-identifications-that-depend-on-identifications"><a name="dependentequality"></a> Identifications that depend on identifications</h3>

<p>If we have an identification <code class="highlighter-rouge">p : A ≡ B</code> of two types <code class="highlighter-rouge">A</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">B</code>, and
elements <code class="highlighter-rouge">a : A</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">b : B</code>, we cannot ask directly whether <code class="highlighter-rouge">a ≡ b</code>,
because although the types are identified by <code class="highlighter-rouge">p</code>, they are not
necessarily the same, in the sense of definitional equality. This is
not merely a syntactical restriction of our formal system, but instead
a fundamental fact that reflects the philosophy of univalent
mathematics. For instance, consider the type</p>

<pre class="Agda">
<a id="87110" class="Keyword">data</a> <a id="Color"></a><a id="87115" href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#87115" class="Datatype">Color</a> <a id="87121" class="Symbol">:</a> <a id="87123" href="Universes.html#611" class="Primitive">𝓤₀</a> <a id="87126" href="Universes.html#1905" class="Function Operator">̇</a>  <a id="87129" class="Keyword">where</a>
 <a id="Color.Black"></a><a id="87136" href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#87136" class="InductiveConstructor">Black</a> <a id="Color.White"></a><a id="87142" href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#87142" class="InductiveConstructor">White</a> <a id="87148" class="Symbol">:</a> <a id="87150" href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#87115" class="Datatype">Color</a>
</pre>

<p>With univalence, we will have that <code class="highlighter-rouge">Color ≡ 𝟚</code> where <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝟚</code> is the
<a href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#binarysum">two-point type</a> <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝟙 + 𝟙</code> with points <code class="highlighter-rouge">₀</code> and
<code class="highlighter-rouge">₁</code>.  But there will be two identifications <code class="highlighter-rouge">p₀ p₁ : Color ≡ 𝟚</code>, one
that identifies <code class="highlighter-rouge">Black</code> with <code class="highlighter-rouge">₀</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">White</code> with <code class="highlighter-rouge">₁</code>, and another one
that identifies <code class="highlighter-rouge">Black</code> with <code class="highlighter-rouge">₁</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">White</code> with <code class="highlighter-rouge">₀</code>. There is no
preferred coding of binary colors as bits.  And, precisely because of
that, even if univalence does give inhabitants of the type <code class="highlighter-rouge">Colour ≡
𝟚</code>, it doesn’t make sense to ask whether <code class="highlighter-rouge">Black ≡ ₀</code> holds without
specifying one of the possible inhabitants <code class="highlighter-rouge">p₀</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">p₁</code>.</p>

<p>What we will have is that <code class="highlighter-rouge">transport id p₀</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">transport id p₁</code> are
the two possible bijections <code class="highlighter-rouge">Color → 𝟚</code> that identify colors with
bits. So, it is not enough to have <code class="highlighter-rouge">Color ≡ 𝟚</code> to be able to compare a
color <code class="highlighter-rouge">c : Color</code> with a bit <code class="highlighter-rouge">b : 𝟚</code>. We need to specify which
identification <code class="highlighter-rouge">p : Color ≡ 𝟚</code> we want to consider for the comparison.
The <a href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#notsets">same considerations</a> apply when we
consider identifications <code class="highlighter-rouge">p : 𝟚 ≡ 𝟚</code>.</p>

<p>So the meaningful comparison in the more general situation is</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">transport id p a ≡ b</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>for a specific</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">p : A ≡ B</code>,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>where <code class="highlighter-rouge">id</code> is the identity function of the universe where the types <code class="highlighter-rouge">A</code>
and <code class="highlighter-rouge">B</code> live, and hence</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">transport id : A ≡ B → (A → B)</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>is the function that transforms identifications into functions, which
has already occurred <a href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#negation">above</a>.</p>

<p>More generally, we want to consider the situation in which we replace
the identity function <code class="highlighter-rouge">id</code> of the universe where <code class="highlighter-rouge">A</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">B</code> live by
an arbitrary type family, which is what we do now.</p>

<p>If we have a type</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">X : 𝓤 ̇</code> ,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and a type family</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">A : X → 𝓥 ̇</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>and points</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">x y : X</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>and an identification</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">p : x ≡ y</code>,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>then we get the identification</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">ap A p : A x ≡ A y</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, if we have</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">a : A x</code>,</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">b : A y</code>,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>we again cannot write down the identity type</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><del><code class="highlighter-rouge">a ≡ b</code></del> .</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is again a non-sensical mathematical statement in univalent
foundations, because the types <code class="highlighter-rouge">A x</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">A y</code> are not the same, but
only identified, and in general there can be many identifications, not
just <code class="highlighter-rouge">ap A p</code>, and so any identification between elements of <code class="highlighter-rouge">A x</code> and
<code class="highlighter-rouge">A y</code> has to be with respect to a specific identification, as in the
above particular case.</p>

<p>So we define a notion of dependent equality between elements <code class="highlighter-rouge">a : A x</code>
and <code class="highlighter-rouge">b : A y</code>, where the dependency is on an given identification
<code class="highlighter-rouge">p : x ≡ y</code>. We write</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">dId A p a b</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>for the type of “identifications of <code class="highlighter-rouge">a</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">b</code> dependent on the
identification <code class="highlighter-rouge">p : x ≡ y</code> over the family <code class="highlighter-rouge">A</code>”.</p>

<p>We can define this by</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">dId A (refl x) a b = (a ≡ b)</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But, because</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">transport A (refl x) a = a</code>,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>by definition, we may as well define <code class="highlighter-rouge">dId</code> as follows in Agda:</p>

<p>We now define special syntax in Agda to be able to write this in the
more symmetrical way</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">a ≡[ p / A ] b</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This stands for equality of <code class="highlighter-rouge">a</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">b</code> dependent on <code class="highlighter-rouge">p</code> over
<code class="highlighter-rouge">A</code>. Because we have chosen to say <em>over</em>, we may as well use the
symbol <code class="highlighter-rouge">/</code> to express this. We define this quaternary mix-fix operator
<code class="highlighter-rouge">_≡[_/_]_</code> with a <a href="https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language/syntax-declarations.html">syntax
declaration</a>
as follows in Agda.</p>

<p>Notice the perhaps unfamiliar nested use of equality: the identity
type <code class="highlighter-rouge">transport A (refl x) a ≡ b</code> is equal to the identity type <code class="highlighter-rouge">a ≡
b</code>.  The proof is the reflexivity identification of the type <code class="highlighter-rouge">a ≡ b</code>.
We rewrite the above making the implicit arguments of <code class="highlighter-rouge">refl</code> explicit
so that it becomes apparent that we are using the identity type former
of a type that happens to be a universe.</p>

Voevodsky</a>.</p>

<p>Once we have defined this notion <code class="highlighter-rouge">_≃_</code> of type equivalence, this
characterization will become an equivalence</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">(σ ≡ τ) ≃ Σ \(p : pr₁ σ ≡ pr₁ τ) → pr₂ σ ≡[ p / A ] pr₂ τ</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But even this is not sufficiently precise, because in general there are
many equivalences between two types. For example, there are precisely
two equivalences</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">𝟙 + 𝟙 ≃ 𝟙 + 𝟙</code>,</p>
</blockquote>

<p>namely the identity function and the function that flips left and
right.  What we want to say is that a <em>specific map</em> is an
equivalence.  In our case, it is the function <code class="highlighter-rouge">from-Σ-≡</code> defined
above.</p>

<p>Voevodsky came up with a definition of a type “<code class="highlighter-rouge">f</code> is an equivalence”
which is always a subsingleton: a given function <code class="highlighter-rouge">f</code> can be an
equivalence in at most one way. But we first discuss <em>hlevels</em>.</p>

<h3 id="-voevodskys-notion-of-hlevel"><a name="hlevel"></a> Voevodsky’s notion of hlevel</h3>

<p>Voevodsky’s hlevels <code class="highlighter-rouge">0,1,2,3,...</code> are shifted by <code class="highlighter-rouge">2</code> with respect to
the <code class="highlighter-rouge">n</code>-groupoid numbering convention, and correspond to <code class="highlighter-rouge">-2</code>-groupoids
(singletons), <code class="highlighter-rouge">-1</code>-groupoids (subsingletons), <code class="highlighter-rouge">0</code>-groupoids (sets),…</p>

<p>First Voevodsky defined a notion of <em>contractible type</em>, which we
refer to here as <em>singleton type</em>.</p>

<p>It is often convenient in practice to have equivalent formulations of

develop <a href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#setscharacterization">soon</a>.</p>

what excluded middle is (like when we said what the twin-prime
conjecture is), in two logically equivalent versions:</p>

<h3 id="-hedbergs-theorem"><a name="hedberg"></a> Hedberg’s Theorem</h3>

<p>To characterize sets as the types of hlevel 2, we first need to show
that subsingletons are sets, and this is not easy. We use an argument
due to
<a href="https://homotopytypetheory.org/references/hedberg/">Hedberg</a>. This
argument also shows that <a href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#hlevelsupper">Voevodsky’s hlevels are upper
closed</a>.</p>

<p>We choose to present an <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-38946-7_14">alternative formulation of Hedberg’s
Theorem</a>,
but we stress that the method of proof is essentially the same.</p>

<p>We first define a notion of constant map:</p>

<p>The prefix “<code class="highlighter-rouge">w</code>” officially stands for “weakly”. Perhaps
<em>incoherently constant</em> or <em>wildly constant</em> would be better
terminologies, with <em>coherence</em> understood in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">∞</code>-categorical
sense. We prefer to stick to <em>wildly</em> rather than <em>weakly</em>, and luckily
both start with the letter “<code class="highlighter-rouge">w</code>”. The following is also probably not
very good terminology, but we haven’t come up with a better one yet.</p>

<p>To be consistent with the above terminology, we have to stipulate that
all types have hlevel <code class="highlighter-rouge">∞</code>. We don’t need a definition for this vacuous
notion. But what may happen (and it does with univalence) is that
there are types which don’t have any finite hlevel. We can say that
such types then have minimal hlevel <code class="highlighter-rouge">∞</code>.</p>

<p><em>Exercise.</em> Formulate and prove the following. The type <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝟙</code> has
minimal hlevel <code class="highlighter-rouge">0</code>. The type <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝟘</code> has minimal hlevel <code class="highlighter-rouge">1</code>, the type <code class="highlighter-rouge">ℕ</code>
has minimal hlevel <code class="highlighter-rouge">2</code>. More ambitiously, when you have
<a href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#univalence">univalence</a> at your disposal, show that
the type of monoids has minimal hlevel <code class="highlighter-rouge">3</code>.</p>

<p><em>Exercise.</em> Students should do this kind of thing at least once in
their academic life: rewrite the above proof of the decidability of
equality of <code class="highlighter-rouge">ℕ</code> to use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ℕ-induction</code> principle <code class="highlighter-rouge">J</code> (or its
alternative <code class="highlighter-rouge">H</code>) instead of pattern matching and recursion, to
understand by themselves that this can be done.</p>

<p>And using the decidability of equality we can define a <code class="highlighter-rouge">wconstant</code>
function <code class="highlighter-rouge">x ≡ y → x ≡ y</code> and hence conclude that <code class="highlighter-rouge">ℕ</code> is a set. This
argument is due to Hedberg.</p>

<p><em>Exercise.</em> Hedberg proved this for any type with decidable
equality. Generalize the above to account for this.</p>

<p><em>Exercise.</em> Prove that the types of magmas, monoids and groups have
hlevel <code class="highlighter-rouge">3</code> (they are <code class="highlighter-rouge">1</code>-groupoids) but not hlevel <code class="highlighter-rouge">2</code> (they are not
sets).  Prove that this is their minimal hlevel. Can you do this with
what we have learned so far?</p>

<p>We use retracts as a mathematical technique to transfer properties
between types. For instance, retracts of singletons are
singletons. Showing that a particular type <code class="highlighter-rouge">X</code> is a singleton may be
rather difficult to do directly by applying the definition of
singleton and the definition of the particular type, but it may be
easy to show that <code class="highlighter-rouge">X</code> is a retract of <code class="highlighter-rouge">Y</code> for a type <code class="highlighter-rouge">Y</code> that is
already known to be a singleton. In these notes, a major application
will be to get a simple proof of the known fact that invertible maps
are equivalences in the sense of Voevodsky.</p>

<p>A <em>section</em> of a function is simply a right inverse, by definition:</p>

<p>Notice that <code class="highlighter-rouge">has-section r</code> is the type of all sections <code class="highlighter-rouge">(s , η)</code> of <code class="highlighter-rouge">r</code>,
which may well be empty. So a point of this type is a designated
section <code class="highlighter-rouge">s</code> of <code class="highlighter-rouge">r</code>, together with the datum <code class="highlighter-rouge">η</code>. Unless the domain of <code class="highlighter-rouge">r</code> is a
set, this datum is not property, and we may well have an element
<code class="highlighter-rouge">(s , η')</code> of the type <code class="highlighter-rouge">has-section r</code> with <code class="highlighter-rouge">η'</code> distinct from <code class="highlighter-rouge">η</code> for the same <code class="highlighter-rouge">s</code>.</p>

<p>We say that <em><code class="highlighter-rouge">X</code> is a retract of <code class="highlighter-rouge">Y</code></em>, written <code class="highlighter-rouge">X ◁ Y</code>, if we
have a function <code class="highlighter-rouge">Y → X</code> which has a section:</p>

<p>This type actually collects <em>all</em> the ways in which the type <code class="highlighter-rouge">X</code> can
be a retract of the type <code class="highlighter-rouge">Y</code>, and so is data or structure on <code class="highlighter-rouge">X</code> and
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Y</code>, rather than a property of them.</p>

<p>A function that has a section is called a retraction. We use this
terminology, ambiguously, also for the function that projects out the
retraction:</p>

<p><em>Exercise.</em> The identity retraction is by no means the only retraction
of a type onto itself in general, of course. Prove that we have (that
is, produce an element of the type) <code class="highlighter-rouge">ℕ ◁ ℕ</code> with the function
<code class="highlighter-rouge">pred : ℕ → ℕ</code> defined above as the retraction, to exercise your Agda
skills. Can you produce more inhabitants of this type?</p>

<p>We have defined <a href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#hlevel">the property of a type being a
singleton</a>. The singleton type <code class="highlighter-rouge">Σ \(y : X) →
x ≡ y</code> induced by a point <code class="highlighter-rouge">x : X</code> of a type <code class="highlighter-rouge">X</code> is denoted by
<code class="highlighter-rouge">singleton-type x</code>. The terminology is justified by the fact that it
is indeed a singleton in the sense defined above.</p>

<h3 id="-voevodskys-notion-of-type-equivalence"><a name="fibersandequivalences"></a> Voevodsky’s notion of type equivalence</h3>

<p>The main notions of univalent mathematics conceived by Voevodsky, with
formulations in MLTT, are those of <a href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#hlevels">singleton
type</a> (or contractible type),
<a href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#hlevels">hlevel</a> (including the notions of
subsingleton and set), and of type equivalence, which we define now.
For that purpose, we need to define the notion of fiber of a function
first.</p>

<p>But we begin with a discussion of the notion of <em>invertible function</em>,
whose only difference with the notion of equivalence is that it is
data rather than property:</p>

<p>The situation is that we will have a logical equivalence between “data
establishing invertibility of a given function” and “the property of
the function being an equivalence”. Mathematically, what happens is
that the type “<code class="highlighter-rouge">f</code> is an equivalence” is a retract of the type “<code class="highlighter-rouge">f</code> is
invertible”. This retraction property is not easy to show, and there
are many approaches. We discuss an approach we came up with while
developing these lecture notes, which is intended to be relatively
simple and direct, but the reader should consult other approaches,
such as that of the HoTT book, which has a well-established
categorical pedigree.</p>

<p>The problem with the notion of invertibility of <code class="highlighter-rouge">f</code> is that, while we
can prove that the inverse <code class="highlighter-rouge">g</code> is unique when it exists, we cannot in
general prove that the identification data <code class="highlighter-rouge">g ∘ f ∼ id</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">f ∘ g ∼
id</code> are also unique, and, indeed, <a href="https://github.com/HoTT/HoTT/blob/master/contrib/HoTTBookExercises.v">they are not in general</a>.</p>

<p>The following is Voevodsky’s proposed formulation of the notion of

<p>So the type <code class="highlighter-rouge">fiber f y</code> collects the points <code class="highlighter-rouge">x : X</code> which are mapped
to a point identified with <code class="highlighter-rouge">y</code>, including the identification
datum. Voevodsky’s insight is that a general notion of equivalence can
be formulated in MLTT by requiring the fibers to be singletons. It is
important here that not only the <code class="highlighter-rouge">y : Y</code> with <code class="highlighter-rouge">f x ≡ y</code> is unique, but
also that the identification datum <code class="highlighter-rouge">p : f x ≡ y</code> is unique. This is
similar to, or even a generalization of the categorical
notion of “uniqueness up to a unique isomorphism”.</p>

<p>There is a canonical transformation <code class="highlighter-rouge">(X Y : 𝓤 ̇ ) → X ≡ Y → X ≃ Y</code> that
sends the identity identification <code class="highlighter-rouge">refl X : X ≡ X</code> to the identity
equivalence <code class="highlighter-rouge">≃-refl X : X ≃ X</code> by induction on identifications. The
univalence axiom, for the universe <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝓤</code>, says that this canonical map
is itself an equivalence.</p>

<p>Thus, the univalence of the universe <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝓤</code> says that identifications <code class="highlighter-rouge">X
≡ Y</code> are in canonical bijection with equivalences <code class="highlighter-rouge">X ≃ Y</code>, if by
bijection we mean equivalence, where the canonical bijection is
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Id-to-Eq</code>.</p>

<p>We emphasize that this doesn’t posit that univalence holds. It says
what univalence is (like the type that says what the <a href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#twinprime">twin-prime
conjecture</a> is).</p>

<p>What characterizes univalent mathematics is not the univalence
axiom. We have defined and studied the main concepts of univalent
mathematics in a pure, spartan MLTT. It is the concepts of hlevel,
including singleton, subsingleton and set, and the notion of
equivalence. Univalence <em>is</em> a fundamental ingredient, but first we
need the correct notion of equivalence to be able to formulate it.</p>

<p><em>Remark</em>. If we formulate univalence with invertible maps instead of
equivalences, we get a statement that is provably false, and this is
one of the reasons why Voevodsky’s notion of equivalence is
important. This is Exercise 4.6 of the <a href="https://homotopytypetheory.org/book/">HoTT
book</a>. There is a <a href="https://github.com/HoTT/HoTT/blob/master/contrib/HoTTBookExercises.v">solution in
Coq</a>
by <a href="https://home.sandiego.edu/~shulman/">Mike Shulman</a>.</p>

<p>Under univalence, we get an induction principle for type equivalences,
corresponding to the induction principles <a href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#H"><code class="highlighter-rouge">H</code></a> and
<a href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#J"><code class="highlighter-rouge">J</code></a> for identifications.</p>

<p>To prove a property of equivalences, it is enough to prove it for the
identity equivalence <code class="highlighter-rouge">≃-refl X</code> for all <code class="highlighter-rouge">X</code>:</p>

<p>The above can be proved without univalence, as is done in the HoTT
book, with a more complicated argument.</p>

<p>Here is a use of the half-adjoint condition, where we remove

<code class="highlighter-rouge">Y</code>, and weaken equality to equivalence in the conclusion. Notice that
the proof starts as that of
<a href="HoTT-UF-Agda#Σ-reindex-retraction"><code class="highlighter-rouge">Σ-reindex-retraction</code></a>.</p>

<p>Here are some facts whose proofs are left to the reader but that we
will need from the next section onwards. Sample solutions are given
<a href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#solutions">below</a>.</p>

<p>Define functions for the following type declarations. As a matter of
procedure, we suggest to import this file and add another declaration
with the same type and new name e.g. <code class="highlighter-rouge">section-are-lc-solution</code>,
because we already have solutions in this file.</p>

<p>We start with the notion of left cancellability.</p>

<p>Function extensionality says that any two pointwise equal functions
are equal. This is known to be not provable or disprovable in
MLTT. It is an independent statement, which we abbreviate as <code class="highlighter-rouge">funext</code>.</p>

<p>There <a href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#hfunext">will be</a> two stronger statements, namely
the generalization to dependent functions, and the requirement that
the canonical map <code class="highlighter-rouge">(f ≡ g) → (f ∼ g) </code> is an equivalence.</p>

<p><em>Exercise.</em> Assuming <code class="highlighter-rouge">funext</code>, prove that if <code class="highlighter-rouge">f : X → Y</code> is an equivalence
then so is the function <code class="highlighter-rouge">(-) ∘ f : (Y → Z) → (X → Z)</code>.</p>

<p>The crucial step in <a href="http://www.math.uwo.ca/faculty/kapulkin/notes/ua_implies_fe.pdf">Voevodsky’s
proof</a>
that univalence implies <code class="highlighter-rouge">funext</code> is to establish the conclusion of the
above exercise assuming univalence instead. We prove this by
<a href="HoTT-UF-Agda.html#equivalence-induction">equivalence induction</a> on
<code class="highlighter-rouge">f</code>, which means that we only need to consider the case when <code class="highlighter-rouge">f</code> is an
identity function, for which pre-composition with <code class="highlighter-rouge">f</code> is itself an
identity function (of a function type), and hence an equivalence:</p>

<p>So notice that this relies on the so-called η-rule for judgmental
equality of functions, namely <code class="highlighter-rouge">f = λ x → f x</code>. Without it, we would
only get that</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code class="highlighter-rouge">f₀ ∼ f₁ → (λ x → f₀ x) ≡ (λ x → f₁ x)</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>instead.</p>

<p>So if all universes are univalent then “being univalent” is a
subsingleton, and hence a singleton. This hypothesis of global
univalence cannot be expressed in our MLTT that only has <code class="highlighter-rouge">ω</code>
many universes, because global univalence would have to live in the
first universe after them. Agda <a href="https://agda.readthedocs.io/en/latest/language/universe-levels.html#expressions-of-kind-set">does have</a> such a universe <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝓤ω,</code> and so
we can formulate it here. There would be no problem in extending our
MLTT to have such a universe if we so wished, in which case we would
be able to formulate and prove:</p>

<p>That the type <code class="highlighter-rouge">global-univalence</code> would be a subsingleton can’t even be formulated in
the absence of a universe of level <code class="highlighter-rouge">ω+1</code>, which this time Agda doesn’t have.</p>

<p>In the absence of a universe <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝓤ω</code> in our MLTT, we can simply have an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_schema">axiom schema</a>, consisting
of <code class="highlighter-rouge">ω</code>-many axioms, stating that each universe is univalent. Then we
can prove in our MLTT that the univalence property for each inverse is
a (sub)singleton, with <code class="highlighter-rouge">ω</code>-many proofs (or just one schematic proof
with a free variable for a universe <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝓤ₙ</code>.).</p>

<h3 id="-hfunext-and-vvfunext-are-subsingletons"><a name="hfunextsubsingleton"></a> <code class="highlighter-rouge">hfunext</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">vvfunext</code> are subsingletons</h3>

<p>This is left as an exercise. Like univalence, the proof that these two
forms of function extensional extensionality require assumptions of
function extensionality at higher universes. So perhaps it is more
convenient to just assume global univalence. An inconvenience is that
the natural tool to use, Π-is-subsingleton, needs products with
explicit arguments, but we made some of the arguments of hfunext and
vvfunext implicit. One way around this problem is to define equivalent
versions with the arguments explicit, and establish an equivalence
between the new version and the original version.</p>

<p><em>Exercise.</em> The hlevels are closed under <code class="highlighter-rouge">Σ</code> and, using <code class="highlighter-rouge">hfunext</code>, also
under <code class="highlighter-rouge">Π</code>. Univalence is not needed, but makes the proof easier.  (If
you don’t use univalence, you will need to show that hlevels are
closed under equivalence.)</p>

<p>The following is Voevosky’s approach to saying that a type is
inhabited in such a way that the statement of inhabitation is a
subsingleton, using <code class="highlighter-rouge">funext</code>.</p>

<p>This says that if we have a function from <code class="highlighter-rouge">X</code> to a subsingleton <code class="highlighter-rouge">P</code>, then
<code class="highlighter-rouge">P</code> must have a point. So this fails when <code class="highlighter-rouge">X=𝟘</code>. Considering <code class="highlighter-rouge">P=𝟘</code>, we conclude
that <code class="highlighter-rouge">¬¬ X</code> if <code class="highlighter-rouge">X</code> is inhabited, which says that <code class="highlighter-rouge">X</code> is non-empty. However,
in the absence of excluded middle, <a href="https://lmcs.episciences.org/3217">inhabitation is stronger than
non-emptiness</a>.</p>

<p>For simplicity in the formulation of the theorems, we assume global
<code class="highlighter-rouge">dfunext</code>.</p>

<p><em>Exercise.</em> An attempt to define the image of <code class="highlighter-rouge">f</code> without the
inhabitation predicate would be to take it to be
<code class="highlighter-rouge">Σ \(y : codomain f) → Σ \(x : domain f) → f x ≡ y</code>. Show that this
type is equivalent to <code class="highlighter-rouge">X</code>. This is similar to what happens in set

<p><em>Exercise.</em> The type <code class="highlighter-rouge">(y : codomain f) → Σ \(x : domain f) → f x ≡ y</code>
 is equivalent to the type <code class="highlighter-rouge">has-section f</code>, which is stronger than
 saying that <code class="highlighter-rouge">f</code> is a surjection.</p>

<p>There are two problems with this definition of inhabitation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Inhabitation has values in the next universe.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We can eliminate into subsingletons of the same universe only.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In particular, it is not possible to show that the map <code class="highlighter-rouge">X →
is-inhabited X</code> is a surjection, or that <code class="highlighter-rouge">X → Y</code> gives <code class="highlighter-rouge">is-inhabited X
→ is-inhabited Y</code> for <code class="highlighter-rouge">X</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Y</code> in arbitrary universes.</p>

<p>There are two proposed ways to solve this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Voevodsky works with certain <a href="http://www.math.ias.edu/vladimir/files/2011_Bergen.pdf">resizing
rules</a> for
subsingletons. At the time of writing, the (relative) consistency
of the system with such rules is an open question.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The HoTT book works with certain higher inductive types (HIT’s),
which are known to have models and hence to be (relatively)
consistent.  This is the same approach adopted by cubical type
theory and cubical Agda.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>A third possibility is to work with subsingleton truncations
<a href="https://lmcs.episciences.org/3217">axiomatically</a>, which is compatible
with the above two proposals. We write this axiom as a record type
rather than as an iterated <code class="highlighter-rouge">Σ type</code> for simplicity, where we use the
HoTT-book notation <code class="highlighter-rouge">∥ X ∥</code> for the inhabitation of <code class="highlighter-rouge">X</code>,
called the propositional, or subsingleton, truncation of <code class="highlighter-rouge">X</code>:</p>

<p>Hence they differ only in size, and when size matters don’t get on the

<p><em>Exercise</em>. If <code class="highlighter-rouge">X</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">Y</code> are types obtained by summing <code class="highlighter-rouge">x-</code> and

<h3 id="-the-univalent-axiom-of-choice"><a name="choice"></a> The univalent axiom of choice</h3>

<p>The axiom of choice says that if for every <code class="highlighter-rouge">x : X</code> there exists <code class="highlighter-rouge">a : A
x</code> with <code class="highlighter-rouge">R x a</code>, where <code class="highlighter-rouge">R</code> is some given relation, then there exists a
choice function <code class="highlighter-rouge">f : (x : X) → A x</code> with <code class="highlighter-rouge">R x (f x)</code> for all <code class="highlighter-rouge">x :
X</code>. This doesn’t hold in general in univalent mathematics, but it does
hold in <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1211.2851">Voevodsky’s simplicial
model</a> of our univalent type theory,
and hence is consistent, provided:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">X</code> is a set,</li>

  <li>the relation <code class="highlighter-rouge">R</code> is subsingleton valued.</li>

<p>It is important that we have the condition that <code class="highlighter-rouge">A</code> is a set-indexed
family of sets and that the relation <code class="highlighter-rouge">R</code> is subsingleton valued. For
arbitrary higher groupoids, it is not in general possible to perform
the choice functorially.</p>

<p>The above is equivalent to another familiar formulation of choice,
namely that a set-indexed product of non-empty sets is non-empty,
where in a constructive setting we generalize <code class="highlighter-rouge">non-empty</code> to
<code class="highlighter-rouge">inhabited</code> (but this generalization is immaterial, because choice
implies excluded middle, and excluded middle implies that
non-emptiness and inhabitation are the same notion).</p>

<p>Now we would like to have <code class="highlighter-rouge">(𝟚 ≡ 𝟚) ≡ 𝟚</code> with univalence, but the
problem is that the type <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝟚 ≡ 𝟚</code> lives in <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝓤₁</code> whereas <code class="highlighter-rouge">𝟚</code> lives in
<code class="highlighter-rouge">𝓤₀</code> and so, having different types, can’t be compared for equality.</p>

<p>Universes are not cumulative in Agda, in the sense that from <code class="highlighter-rouge">X : 𝓤</code>
we would get <code class="highlighter-rouge">X : 𝓤⁺</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">X : 𝓤 ⊔ 𝓥</code>.  The usual approach is to
consider embeddings of universes into larger universes:</p>
